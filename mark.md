## Project Description 
 This application was developed to make it easy and quick to generate a readme file for software application development projects.  It uses the inquirer package provided by NPM to lead the user through a series of prompts answering questions relevant to the project.  When the user is finished answering the questions, a readme file is generated with sections and contact information.

## Application Testing Instructions 
 The application can be tested by executing it and seeing if there is anything that does not work correctly.

## Usage Instructions 
 The application is fairly intuitive.  The user who developed the software will know the answers to the questions and the readme file generation is automated.
