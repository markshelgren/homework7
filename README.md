# Readme File Generator

## Project Description

This application was developed to make it easy and quick to generate a readme file for software application development projects. It uses the inquirer package provided by NPM to lead the user through a series of prompts answering questions relevant to the project. When the user is finished answering the questions, a readme file is generated with sections and contact information.

## Installation Instructions

The project can be installed by "cloning" it from Gitub.

## Application Testing Instructions

The application can be tested by executing it and seeing if there is anything that does not work correctly.

## Usage Instructions

The application is fairly intuitive. The user who developed the software will know the answers to the questions and the readme file generation is automated.
