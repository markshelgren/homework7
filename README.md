# Create a professional Readme File Generator

## Project Description 
 This project was developed to provide an application that can be used to generate a professional readme file.   The command line application uses the inquirer package provided by NPM to lead the user through a series of prompts.  The answers to the prompt are then used to generate a readme file that will look good and correctly describe the project.
